<h2 id="content">Full-Stack Solutionary</h2>
<p>Sometimes I don't even know what "full-stack" is supposed to mean! On the other hand, I do feel somewhat confident about picking up new concepts in unfamiliar languages; that's part of the key of being a successful computer scientist, after all. Without further do, I present my "full-stack" experiences.</p>

		<h3>Front-End</h3>
		<p>Before software development, I really enjoyed art, drawing, and photography so it makes total sense that I really found myself liking front-end development. I was taught to use the modular Angular 8/9 toolkit.</p>
		<p> However, sometimes that framework just too clunky; plus, I'm always open to learning and using new tools! Here are some others I've used: </p>
		<ul>
		<li> React 	</li>
		<li> Vue 	</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Back-End</h3>
		<p>The backend is super cool; I have used some PHP on custom WordPress theme developments, Flask for quick prototyping, and .NET Core for cross-platform distributed system compatability in production. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Database</h3>
		<p>Whether it's SQL Server for the .NET prod server, PostgreSQL to co-manage local records for triggering events after user interaction, or some other database like MariaDB or even NoSQL, the best thing to do is to know why some databases perform some types of tasks better and worse than some other databases. Usually, I spent my time on SQL Server and MySQL for quickly prototyping Flask web apps.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>Okay, okay, this one is my weak point. But it's only because I'm new to it, and I'm really working on this one, okay? Seriously though, this one cannot be overlooked, especially when considering handling sensitive information such as user credentials and payment information over a public wire. Don't even get me started on exploit vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS-type exploits, or even man-in-the-middle (MITM) techniques because I can go on all day. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
		<h3>ToolKit</h3>
		<p>I've come to learn to enjoy using VSCode for most programming or textual assignments, LaTex type engine for reports and official documents, and a few other minor preferences, but here is the kicker: I really don't get "married" to a toolset. I mean, sure, I have some expertise in a couple subdomains, but my success has always derived from remaining flexible, adaptable, and diligent in practicing new techniques!</p>
